### Abstract

One of the most well-known expressions of Bell’s Inequality is the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) Inequality. A violation of the CHSH inequality occurs when S, a quantity calculated
from a series of experimental measurements of the polarizations of a pair of photons, is greater
than 2. In this work, the conditions needed to violate the CHSH Inequality were investigated
through a numerical simulation. Any combination of a maximally entangled Bell state and a
statistical mixture could be created using the density matrix formalism. The probabilities of
coincidence detection for sets of fixed settings of the first polarizer angle as functions of the
variable angle 𝜃 of the second polarizer were calculated with different contributions from pure
and mixed states. The measurement probability followed the predicted cos2θ-dependence for
pure input states. The visibility of that dependence could be reduced to 0 by introducing a greater
proportion of the mixed state. A set of angles that maximally violate the CHSH Inequality for
each Bell state were found to be 0°, 22.5°, 45°, and 67.5° for the φ+ and ψ- Bell states, and 45°,
337.5°, 0°, and 22.5° for the φ- and ψ+ Bell states. It was found that in order to measure a
violation of the CHSH inequality at these angles, there must be an experimental visibility of at
least 71%. The difference between classical and quantum states can be demonstrated by
comparing the obtained values of S while varying Δ, a parameter that calculates a set of
experimental polarizer angles. It was found that while a mixed state and a pure entangled state
have the same joint measurement probability for a given Δ, only an entangled state will result in
a violation of the inequality. This work was supported with funding from Undergraduate
